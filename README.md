Cygwin required install:

Qt5:
"qt5-base"  for run-time
"qt5-devel" for qmake

X11: QT5 need X11 library for initialize GUI
"xorg-server"
"xinit"
"xterm"

Step:
1. edit xxx.pro
2. qmake xxx.pro
3. make (here maybe need to manually remove "-lGl -lpthread" from "Makefile")
4. startxwin -- -multiwindow
5. export DISPLAY=:0.0
6. ./xxx.exe

Details :
The sources define a class named **`ImageGridWindow`** which inherits publicly from **`QWidget`**. This inheritance indicates that `ImageGridWindow` is a fundamental building block for creating user interface elements in Qt, capable of containing other widgets and handling events.

The class definition includes the macro **`Q_OBJECT`** as its first element within the class body. This is a crucial aspect in the context of Qt, as it declares the class as a Qt object that utilizes Qt's **meta-object system**. This system provides features such as signals and slots for inter-object communication, run-time type information, and dynamic properties. Although the provided code doesn't explicitly use signals or slots, the presence of `Q_OBJECT` suggests that the `ImageGridWindow` is designed to potentially leverage these Qt mechanisms for interaction and event handling.

The `ImageGridWindow` class has the following private member variables:

*   **`QLabel* imageLabel;`**: This is a pointer to a `QLabel` object, which is intended to display a single image within the grid.
*   **`QGridLayout* gridLayout;`**: This is a pointer to a `QGridLayout` object. A `QGridLayout` manages a grid of widgets, arranging them in rows and columns. In this case, it will be a 6x6 grid.
*   **`QPixmap pix1, pix2, pix3, pix4;`**: These are `QPixmap` objects, which are used to store image data for the images that will be displayed in the grid. The constructor loads image files into these `QPixmap`s. The comments indicate these are intended to be loaded from "snorlax.jpg", "bulbasaur.jpg", "charmeleon.jpg", and "pikachu.jpg" respectively, although these paths are commented as placeholders.
*   **`int currentRow, currentCol;`**: These integer variables keep track of the current row and column where the `imageLabel` is placed within the `gridLayout`. They are initialized to -1 in the constructor, indicating that initially no image is placed in the grid.

The class has the following public member function:

*   **`ImageGridWindow(QWidget* parent = nullptr)`**: This is the constructor of the `ImageGridWindow` class. It takes an optional `QWidget` parent. Inside the constructor, the window title is set to "Image Grid Mover", and the window size is fixed at 640x480. A **6x6 `QGridLayout`** is created and set as the layout for the `ImageGridWindow`, with no spacing or margins between the cells. The constructor then initializes the grid with empty `QLabel` widgets, each sized to be 106x80 pixels (640/6 by 480/6). The constructor also loads the image files into the `pix1`, `pix2`, `pix3`, and `pix4` `QPixmap` objects and creates the `imageLabel`, setting its size to match a grid cell and aligning its content to the center. The `currentRow` and `currentCol` are initialized to -1.

The class also has a protected member function:

*   **`void keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent* event) override`**: This function is overridden from the base class `QWidget`. It is called whenever a key is pressed while the `ImageGridWindow` has focus. This function handles different key presses to control the display and movement of the image. If no image is currently placed (`currentRow == -1 && currentCol == -1`), pressing keys '1', '2', '3', or '4' will load the corresponding image (`pix1` to `pix4`), scale it to the size of a grid cell while maintaining aspect ratio, and then place it at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the grid using the `placeImage` function. If an image is already placed, the arrow keys (Left, Right, Up, Down) are used to move the image to an adjacent cell within the 6x6 grid. Pressing number keys '1' through '4' when an image is already present will change the image displayed in the `imageLabel`. Finally, `update()` is called to refresh the display after a key press event.

The class has a private member function:

*   **`void placeImage(int row, int col)`**: This function is responsible for placing the `imageLabel` at a specific `row` and `col` within the `gridLayout`. First, it checks if an image is currently placed. If so, it removes the `imageLabel` from its current position in the grid layout. Then, it adds the `imageLabel` to the `gridLayout` at the specified `row` and `col`, and updates the `currentRow` and `currentCol` member variables to reflect the new position.

In the larger context of the Image Grid Window, this class definition sets up the fundamental structure and behavior of the application. It creates a window containing a grid of empty cells and allows a single image to be loaded and moved within this grid using keyboard input. The use of `QLabel` for both the empty grid cells and the image display, along with `QGridLayout` for managing their layout, are key elements in achieving this functionality within the Qt framework. The inclusion of `Q_OBJECT` indicates the potential for this class to be extended with more advanced Qt features in the future.
